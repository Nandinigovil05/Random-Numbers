## Random-Numbers
### Program to depict the chances of possible outcome when the process is repeated large number of times. This is also known as  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_of_large_numbers" target="_blank">  "Law of Large Numbers". </a>

### Coin-toss simulation:
Consider tossing a coin for 10 times, you may get 6 head 4 tail or 7 head 3 tail or 10 heads(😂) but the chances of getting 5 heads 5 tails
are maximum,<br> 
you can proove it easily by P&C (10C5, yes you got it.) for now let' see by by simulating/doing this process for 10k times:

When process is repeated 10,000 times, chances of occurring 5 heads or tails in 10 toss becomes maximum. 🙌 <br>
The process is helpful for the kind of problem discussed below.

### Random-walk simulation:
 Consider a intriguing Problem of Thowing Dice vs Taking steps against the following Rules:

#### The Problem may seem challenging at first but what if we can reach upon a conclusion by doing the process large number of times. 👨‍💻

 Above graph shows distribution of number of steps reached when the process is simulated 500 times.
 Clearly, it gives an idea that reaching steps 60 to 80 has a fair chance occuring. 
 For example:<br>
step 60 has occured ≈ 80 times in 500  <br> 
step 70 has occured ≈ 140 times in 500 <br>
step 80 has occured ≈ 120 times in 500 <br><br>
This way we can reach upon a conclusion to bet and win!😎✌️
